                           Supplement for MS-DOS, PC-DOS
              
                           Assembler Package Release 5.0
              
              
              
          Date-Time Access:
              
              The  date  and  time  for  listings  are obtained from the
              operating system. 
              
              
              
          Symbol Table Space:
              
              The various programs  will  take  as  much  memory  as  is
              available (but not more than 32766 bytes) for symbol table
              space  or  buffer space in the case of the SPLIT and IMAGE
              programs. 
              
              Some difficulty has been encountered  in  determining  how
              much  space is really available when running on the PC-Jr.
              The "-Z" command line option allows the  user  to  specify
              symbol  table  space  directly.   See the Package Overview
              Manual for "-Z" option details. 
              
              If you get an "ALLOC" error message, run the program  with
              the  "-1" option to discover how much space the program is
              trying to take.  The value  displayed  is  the  number  of
              bytes  given  in  hexadecimal.  Run the program again with
              the "-Z" option to specify a smaller amount of space.   It
              will  take  some experimentation to find the maximum value
              that will work for a given program. 
              
              
              
          Maximum Number of Open Files:
              
              The maximum number of open files is determined by your DOS
              "config.sys" file.  If the Quelo software  has  difficulty
              opening  files,  try increasing the maximum.  In the worst
              case, the Quelo software requires 6 open files plus 2 more
              for a total of 8 if redirection is used. 
              
              
              
          Path Names:
              
              Path names are not supported. 
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
 
          (c) 1985 by QUELO                                           1
